[![Build Status](https://app.bitrise.io/app/1c5df9218034c99c/status.svg?token=ma7caOlYJCmGpv3BreCUoQ)](https://app.bitrise.io/app/1c5df9218034c99c)

Overview
--------
Thermal Economy Smart System, these words enclose the main goals of this project.
Started as a game and some experimentation it has become a real side project that trying to provide a cheap, easy and smart thermal system for every user who wants to try it out for free.

The entire project is designed to work on Android Things, used to collect and organize all sensor data and send it to Firebase.
The thermal data collected by the sensors is obtained by exploiting the Aqara Gateway from Xiaomi. 
This Gateway provides a developer mode that exposes into the LAN some open port to communicate with it and retrieve the sensors data.
On the other side, Firebase collects the organized dataset and provide a back-end structure to the mobile application.

Tech Specs
----------
The main focus of this project is to use and play with all the latest best technologies available for Android Development.
TESS is entirely written in Kotlin and it uses lots of useful libraries, that is right now a defacto standard.
Some examples:
*  [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture)
*  [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines)
*  [Koin](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin) (Dependency Injection)
*  [Arrow](https://arrow-kt.io/) (Functional Programming)
*  [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) (Database)
*  [Firebase Firestone](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore/) (Remote Database)
*  [Mockk](https://mockk.io/) (Mocking Library)

Project Status Backlog
----------------------

* [x] ~~Create a base structure for the project~~
* [x] ~~Receive the Multicast messages from the Aqara Gateway~~
* [x] ~~Communicate with the Gateway via UDP messages~~
* [x] ~~Create a mechanism that can automatically detect the paired sensors and identify those~~
* [ ] Create a first back-end structure based on Firebase technologies
* [ ] Start Mobile App development
* [ ] Organize the data collected from the Aqara Gateway and store it in Firebase Firestone
* [ ] Integrate the Mobile App with the back-end
* [ ] And so on...
